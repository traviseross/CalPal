## [1.x.x] - Previous Versions

### Added
- **Phase 2: Single Writer Pattern** - Architectural upgrade to prevent race conditions
  - New `unified_calendar_sync.py` service: single source of truth for Google Calendar writes
  - Database is now authoritative source, Google Calendar is presentation layer
  - Orphaned mirror detection and automatic cleanup
  - Batch processing with `--batch-size` and `--deletions-only` flags
  - **Systemd Services**: Replaced cron jobs with proper systemd timers
    - `calpal-scanner.timer`: Runs scanner hourly to detect manual deletions
    - `calpal-sync.timer`: Runs unified sync every 30 minutes (deletions-only)
  - Created `cleanup_all_deletions.sh` for overnight batch cleanup

### Changed
- **25Live Sync** - Converted to DB-only mode (no direct Google Calendar writes)
  - **CRITICAL FIX**: Now checks BOTH `25live_reservation_id` AND `25live_event_id` for deletions
  - Prevents infinite re-creation bug (e.g., CCC President's Meeting recreated 418 times)
  - Events marked as `pending_creation` in database
  - unified_calendar_sync handles Google Calendar creation

- **Calendar Scanner** - Converted to read-only mode
  - Removed `_remove_deleted_events()` method
  - Deletion now handled exclusively by unified_calendar_sync
  - Prevents race conditions between multiple services

- **ICS Generator** - Converted to database-only source (Phase 2 complete)
  - No longer queries Google Calendar directly
  - Reads all events from PostgreSQL database
  - **Anonymization**: Student appointments show as "Student appointment"
  - **Location Enhancement**: Classes show location (e.g., "Class in Ross Center ROS 105")
  - Excludes Personal and Family calendars
  - Respects database `deleted_at` field
  - Auto-restarts Flask server after generation

### Added (from previous work)
- **Deletion Detection & Removal** - Calendar Scanner now automatically detects and removes deleted events
  - Detects events deleted from Google Calendar and marks them in database
  - Removes events marked as deleted from Google Calendar (e.g., blacklisted events)
  - Bidirectional sync ensures database and Google Calendar stay consistent
  - Graceful handling of already-deleted events (404/410 errors)
  - Batch processing up to 500 deletions per scan

- **Recently Deleted Event Protection** - Prevents infinite deletion/re-creation loops
  - New `check_recently_deleted()` method in DatabaseManager
  - Scanner skips events deleted within last hour (configurable window)
  - Prevents race condition between reconciler deletion and scanner re-creation

- **Two-Layer Rate Limiting** - Comprehensive Google Calendar API rate limit handling
  - **Proactive throttling**: 100ms delay between API calls (10 QPS, well under Google's limit)
  - **Reactive backoff**: Exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s...) with automatic retry on rate limit hits
  - Eliminates 200+ rate limit errors per scan

- **Flask Auto-Refresh** - ICS Generator now restarts Flask server after generating new files
  - Ensures Flask always serves the latest ICS file
  - Prevents stale file caching issues

- **Event Blacklist Manager** - Interactive tool to manage unwanted 25Live events
  - Support for exact match and regex pattern blacklisting
  - Shows matching events in database
  - Automatically marks matching events as deleted
  - Integration with Calendar Scanner for removal

### Changed
- **Calendar Scanner** - Major improvements to event classification and rate limiting
  - Now recognizes subcalendar mirrors via `mirror_type='subcalendar_to_work'` in extendedProperties
  - Always updates events on each scan (not just when times/summary change)
  - Checks for `event_type` changes and auto-corrects misclassifications
  - Skips recently deleted events to prevent re-creation loops
  - Added `_detect_deletions()` method to compare calendar vs database
  - Added `_remove_deleted_events()` method with rate limiting
  - New database event states: `scanner_detected_deletion`, `removed_from_google`, `already_removed`

- **Database Manager** - Enhanced event tracking and duplicate prevention
  - `record_event()` now updates `event_type` field (fixes misclassifications)
  - New `check_recently_deleted()` method with configurable time window
  - Better handling of event lifecycle transitions

- **Work Calendar Reconciler** - Improved orphaned event detection
  - Now handles orphaned mirrors of ANY event_type (not just 'subcalendar_work_mirror')
  - Queries ALL events with `source_event_id` for comprehensive cleanup
  - Prevents orphaned events from escaping detection due to misclassification

- **Flask Server** - Disabled ICS file caching for always-fresh content
  - Added no-cache headers: `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`
  - Disabled etag caching
  - Ensures clients always receive latest calendar data

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Infinite Duplicate Loop** - Fixed 4 critical leaks causing deletion/re-creation loop
  - **Leak #1**: Scanner now correctly identifies subcalendar mirrors (was misclassifying as 'other')
  - **Leak #2**: Scanner no longer re-creates recently deleted events (1-hour cooldown)
  - **Leak #3**: Reconciler now cleans up orphaned events of any type (not just typed correctly)
  - **Leak #4**: Scanner auto-corrects event_type misclassifications on subsequent scans
  - Result: 149 mistyped events will auto-correct, 7 persistent problem events will be removed

- **Google Calendar API Rate Limiting** - Eliminated 200+ rate limit errors per scan
  - Added proactive 100ms delay between API calls (prevents rate limits)
  - Added reactive exponential backoff with retry (handles edge cases)
  - Scanner now completes deletion phase without errors

- **Event Misclassification** - Events now correctly classified and auto-corrected
  - Subcalendar mirrors properly detected via extendedProperties metadata
  - Existing misclassifications fixed on next scan
  - Prevents orphaned events from escaping cleanup

- **ICS File Staleness** - Flask no longer caches ICS files, always serves fresh content
- **Blacklisted Events Not Removed** - Calendar Scanner now removes blacklisted events from Google Calendar
- **Deletion Detection Missing** - System now detects when events are manually deleted from calendars

### Documentation
- Updated SERVICES.md with comprehensive deletion detection documentation
- Added deletion flow diagrams and state transition examples
- Documented Flask cache control and auto-restart behavior
- Updated README.md to highlight deletion detection feature
- Added database event state documentation

### Planned Features
- Migration tracking system in database
- Web UI for configuration and monitoring
- Email notifications for sync failures
- Advanced event filtering rules
- Multi-user support with separate credentials
- Prometheus metrics export
- Grafana dashboards

## Known Issues

### Version 1.0.0

**Minor Issues:**
